# Alfred Toolkit for GitHub

The GitHub Toolkit for Alfred makes it easy to quickly access GitHub's web features, including Pull Requests, Issues, Explore, Trending and more with the `github` keyword.

You can also quickly access your own GitHub content once you've set up your account (see below) with the `my` keyword.

You can also create new repositories, gists, organizations, and projects with the `new` keyword.

You will need to be signed in to your GitHub account in your default web browser to make the most of this workflow.

This workflow doesn't support programmatic access to GitHub. For that, I would recommend [GitHub Repos workflow for Alfred](https://github.com/edgarjs/alfred-github-repos) by [@edgarjs](https://github.com/edgarjs) or [GitHub Search](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/alfred-github-search) by [@pawelgrzybek](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/).
